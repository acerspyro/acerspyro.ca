					<h3>Backstory? Backstory.</h3>
					<p>
						Hello there, my name is Maxim Therrien, known as Acerspyro around the Internet.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am a 17 year old computer enthusiast who enjoys finding new ways to use technology to make cool new stuff. I am also a collegian on his way of getting a DCS in software development at the Édouard Montpetit CÉGEP. French is my native tongue (I'm a Québécois, after all), but as you can see, I can speak English just as well (Note: If you want to read this site in French, there's a button in the topbar).
					</p>

					<h3>Skills</h3>
					<p>
						To be fair, even though I have not really worked anywhere (yet, and I'd love to work somewhere, believe me), I did contribute to a few open source projects (See the section called "A small Introduction"), but I also have a month-long internship experience in the IT domain at an accounting firm known as Fuller Landau. They are very nice people and I really enjoyed the experience, because for once, I felt useful. This is really all I need to be productive: make me useful, and I will work relentlessly.

					<h3>A small Introduction</h3>
					<p>
						Oh boy! A website entirely dedicated to me! But I'm not here to brag about it.
					</p>
					<p>
						I usually like to stick around on Freenode's IRC, often in #web, helping people with their webdev stuff. I love making cool, nifty stuff on Codepen when I get bored. You should check it out, it's all showcased later on this page!
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyways, I have contributed to quite a few open source projects on GitHub and I am part of the Neothyne team (You may not know what that is, I do not blame you). I used to be part of the Red Eclipse team as well, I mostly contributed in scripts and art assets, but also worked as a team with other people to make things work.
