	<h3>Who I am</h3>
	<p>
		My name is <em>Maxim Therrien</em>, known as <em>Acerspyro</em> on the Internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am an 18 year old computer enthusiast who enjoys finding ways to use technology to make cool stuff.
		I am currently studying at EFPC (<i>École de Formation Professionelle de Châteauguay</i>) in tech support.
		My native tongue is French and I reside in the south shore of Montreal.
	</p>
	<p>
		Do you run a small business and need a nice website? I am actively looking for web projects to work on, and I would be more than happy to put together whatever it is you have in mind!
	</p>
";
$_SECTION_SKILLS = "
	<h3>Skills</h3>
	<p>
		I am fluent in both French and English.<br/>
		Working with either Microsoft's Office suite, Google Docs or even LibreOffice is no problem for me.<br/>
		I can count up to 10 and more, and I use Linux as my day to day operating system, meaning I will have no problem dealing with a Linux installation.<br/>
		All of my graphics work is done with Inkscape and GIMP (because they're free and awesome!)
	</p>

	<h3>What I do</h3>
	<p>
		This website has a lot of \"I\"'s, doesn't it? Anyways.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can find me on Freenode's IRC in #web, where I stick around to help people with everything webdev-related.
	</p>
	<p>
		Vector art assets are my thing, even my raster graphics often start out as vector art in Inkscape.
